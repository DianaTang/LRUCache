# LRUCache
This was written in Java. 
I made assumptions that I wasn't going to worry about error handling and it was sufficient to provide nulls.

I wrote out my brute force testing of this all in main function.    
You can't necessarily compile this however you can copy this onto https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/ and it will run.
